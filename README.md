How to develop secure code that complies with security testing protocols.

1.)Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that required improved security for its software application. The company was concerned about protecting sensitive data during transmission and storage. The primary issue that needed to be addressed was identifying existing security vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices.

2.) What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

One area in which I performed well was identifying software security vulnerabilities using automated analysis tools without disrupting existing functionality. Secure coding is important because it reduces the risk of data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage from failing to secure the application. Strong software security adds long-term value to a company by protecting trust in the business, ensuring regulatory compliance, and supporting stable, reliable operations.

3.) Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was interpreting vulnerability reports and determining which findings were legitimate risks versus false positives. This was also one of the most helpful aspects of the project because it taught me how to analyze security data and make informed decisions on how to limit risks.

4.) How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by implementing things such as encrypted communication using HTTPS, applying modern cryptographic standards, and evaluating third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities. In the future, I would use tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis tools, and industry frameworks like NIST guidelines to assess vulnerabilities and select appropriate mitigation strategies.

5.) How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the application remained functional and secure after refactoring, I verified that security changes did not introduce new vulnerabilities by re-running dependency scans and validating secure communication through encrypted connections.

6.) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

This project introduced me to several tools, including OWASP Dependency-Check, Java Keytool for certificate generation, secure cryptographic standards, and structured code review techniques. These tools and practices will be highly useful in future development tasks involving secure software development.

7.) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

For future employers, I would highlight this project as evidence of my ability to perform vulnerability assessments, apply secure coding practices, and balance security improvements with functional requirements. The completed security documentation demonstrates my understanding of software security challenges and my ability to follow industry-standard best practices.
